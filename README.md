You're looking at a large component in your **Vue or Nuxt** project. You see `<p>{{ user.name }}</p>`. You pause. You ask yourself:

> "Where is `user` coming from? Is it a `prop`? A `ref`? From the Pinia store? Or just a local `const`?"

So you scroll. You jump to the `<script setup>` block, find the variable, and then jump back. A few lines later, you do it again for another variable. Each jump is a small interruption, a tiny context switch that breaks your flow and drains your mental energy.

**VueGlimpse eliminates these jumps.** It gives you immediate, at-a-glance insight into your data's origin, right where you're workingâ€”inside your `<template>`.

## How It Solves Your Pain

-   ðŸ§  **Reduces Cognitive Load:** Stop holding a mental map of your component's state. The editor does it for you.
-   âš¡ **Boosts Your Flow State:** Stay focused on your template logic without constant context switching. Make faster, more confident decisions.
-   ðŸš€ **Speeds Up Onboarding & Code Reviews:** Jump into an unfamiliar Vue or Nuxt component and instantly understand its data flow. No more codebase archeology.

## Features

-   **Future-Ready for Vue & Nuxt:** Built for the entire modern Vue ecosystem (Vue 3+, Nuxt 3+).
-   **At-a-glance Origin Indicators:** Subtle icons tell you the source of your data.
-   **Compiler-Level Accuracy:** Powered by the official `@vue/compiler-sfc`, the same engine Vue and Nuxt use.
-   **Full Component API Visibility:** Correctly identifies `props`, `emits` (`defineEmits`, `$emit`), passthrough `attrs`/`slots` (`useAttrs`, `useSlots`, `$attrs`, `$slots`), `ref`, `reactive`, `computed`, and variables from store patterns.
-   **Blazing Fast:** Intelligent caching ensures analysis only runs when files change, not every time you switch tabs.
-   **Zero Configuration:** Install it and it just works.
